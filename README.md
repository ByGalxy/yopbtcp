无论你是否有昼夜的概念，首先先祝大家早上，中午，晚上好！

Regardless of whether you have a concept of day and night, first wish everyone good morning, noon, and evening!

我最近在机房学习，但是发现机房电脑关机的速度是否的慢，必须要我们关完再走

而且我发现只要机房的电脑使用不了就会不管，但是会有人来修，只要的话，学校就可以换好的设备

这个称不上什么恶作剧，因为机房的电脑会用镜像还原系统，根本玩不坏！！！

于是我再思考着🤔，可不可以就是有一种方法可以，“马上关机”

于是就写好python代码

部分代码是根据教程顺手塞进去的

# 介绍
首先来介绍一下代码原理，这里会随便讲讲，可能会有讲错的地方

代码运行后会检查一些环境

特别是会检查名为“ByGalxy.txt”的文件，如果有这个文件，会触发 “萌新提醒器”

正式运行后，代码会多线程复制文件

例如：1变2,2变4,4变16...等，反正会越变越多

同时也会显示“小黑塔~”和"大安比~"的图片

在代码这样的操作下

就会很快的导致电脑卡顿，最后黑屏（我希望的效果是这样的）

I have been studying in the server room recently. However, I noticed that the shut-off speed of the server computers is slow and they need to be turned off completely before we can leave.

Moreover, I found that whenever the server computers are not working properly, it doesn't matter whether someone comes to fix them or not. If the school has the necessary equipment, it will be replaceable.

This doesn't qualify as a joke because the server computers have the ability to automatically restore the system using images, so they don't play any harm!

I thought about this critically for a while and realized that there might be a better way. "Switch off immediately" came to mind. I then wrote some Python code based on what I had learned.

Some of the code was taken from the tutorial.

# Introduction
Here is a translation of the given text:

First let's introduce the code principle. Here I will simply talk about it - there might be some errors.

After running the code, it checks some environment. In particular, it checks for the existence of a file named "ByGalxy.txt". If this file exists, it triggers the 'newbie reminder' alert.

After formal execution, the code multi-threadedly copies files.

For example: 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, 4 becomes 16... et cetera. In any case, it will keep increasing.

At the same time, it displays the image "small black tower" and "big Anba". 

In this kind of operation, the computer will quickly become unresponsive, eventually showing a black screen (I hope that is the effect I want).
